      <p>
        AN INTIMATE, AUTHOR-DRIVEN PHOTO WALK IN PRÍNCIPE REAL, ONE OF LISBON'S MOST
        CULTURALLY ACTIVE AND VISUALLY DISTINCT NEIGHBOURHOODS.
      </p>
      <p>
        CONCEIVED AND LED BY PEDRO, FOUNDER OF ALTA PHOTO LISBOA, A PHOTOGRAPHER WITH OVER
        25 YEARS OF PRACTICE ACROSS EDITORIAL, COMMERCIAL AND CONCEPTUAL WORK.
      </p>
      <p>
        DURING THE WALK, EACH PARTICIPANT IS PHOTOGRAPHED AS THE CENTRAL SUBJECT OF A
        PERSONAL EDITORIAL, BECOMING THE MODEL AND PROTAGONIST OF THE NARRATIVE.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALTA PHOTO LISBOA SHARES SPACE WITH ALTA RECORDS LISBOA, HOME TO A VINYL COLLECTION
        BUILT OVER 35 YEARS BY SÉRGIO, A LIFELONG COLLECTOR AND DJ.
      </p>
      <p>
        QUIET STREETS, EVERYDAY SPACES, SHOPS, CAFÉS AND PRAÇA DAS FLORES DEFINE THE WALK —
        PLACES SHAPED BY LOCAL LIFE RATHER THAN TOURISM.
      </p>
      <p>
        EACH PARTICIPANT RECEIVES ONE PRINTED 1/2 PHOTOGRAPHY, PRINTED AND SIGNED BY THE
        PHOTOGRAPHER. THE COMPLETE EDITORIAL SELECTION IS SHARED PRIVATELY VIA DOWNLOAD LINK.
      </p>
      <p>DURATION: APPROXIMATELY 2 HOURS.</p>
      <p>PRICE PER PARTICIPANT: 150 €.</p>
