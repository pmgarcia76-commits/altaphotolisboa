    <section class="walk-text">
      <p>An intimate, author-driven photo walk in Príncipe Real, Lisbon's most culturally active and visually distinct neighbourhood.</p>

      <p>Conceived and led by Pedro, photographer and founder of Alta Photo Lisboa, each participant is photographed as the central subject of a personal editorial. The participant becomes the model and protagonist of the narrative.</p>

      <p>The walk starts at Alta Photo Lisboa, shared with Alta Records Lisboa — home to a 35-year vinyl collection curated by Sérgio, lifelong collector and DJ.</p>

      <p>Quiet streets, everyday spaces, shops, cafés and Praça das Flores shape the walk — places defined by local life rather than tourism.</p>

      <p>Each participant receives one printed 1/1 photography, printed and signed by the photographer. The full editorial is shared privately via download link.</p>

      <p>Duration: approximately 2 hours.<br>
      Price per participant: 150 €.</p>
