      <p>
        An intimate, author-driven photo walk in Príncipe Real, one of Lisbon's most
        culturally active and visually distinct neighbourhoods.
      </p>

      <p>
        Conceived and led by Pedro, founder of Alta Photo Lisboa, a photographer with over
        25 years of practice across editorial, commercial and conceptual work.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the walk, each participant is photographed as the central subject of a
        personal editorial, becoming the model and protagonist of the narrative.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alta Photo Lisboa shares space with Alta Records Lisboa, home to a vinyl collection
        built over 35 years by Sérgio, a lifelong collector and DJ.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quiet streets, everyday spaces, shops, cafés and Praça das Flores define the walk —
        places shaped by local life rather than tourism.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each participant receives one printed ½ photography, printed and signed by the
        photographer. The complete editorial selection is shared privately via download link.
      </p>

      <p>Duration: approximately 2 hours.</p>
      <p>Price per participant: 150 €.</p>
